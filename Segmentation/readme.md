# Segmentation

The actual segmentation trained code has been implemented on the propetiary code given by Philip.Hence we are not disclosing here.

The ``Segmenatation.ipynb`` file presented here is built by us specifically for our use case. But we did not use this to segmentation. This is for our understanding on the segmentation process.
