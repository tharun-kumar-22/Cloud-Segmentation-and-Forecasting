# Cloud Segmentation and Forecasting

## Confluence 

The [Confluence page](https://cloudforecasting.atlassian.net/wiki/x/VQAC) contains our documentation throughtout the project. It contains the presentations , discussions , project planning files etc.,

## Data and Trained models


The [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zqoe6IcC4lDn-l16Ai4ma4I-dVnTyz9v) provides the data that we have used for the project and the trained models. The LES data is publicly available [here](https://opendata.physik.lmu.de/5d0k9-q2n86/) also but the projected images and the segmented images are available in our drive link. The drive also provides the ASI segmented images that can be used for segmentation purposes.

`app.py` - Short demo of segmentation and cloud motion prediction.

#### How to run app..?
1. Download our two models (segmentation and cloud motion estimation) and dataset from google drive
2. change the paths in app.py.
3. Run the app.
